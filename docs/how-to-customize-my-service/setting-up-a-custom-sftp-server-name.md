To personalize your storage, you can replace SFTP To Go's hostname with a subdomain of a domain you own. To do so, copy your SFTP To Go hostname from the dashboard and add a CNAME record to point to the hostname. For example (make sure to use the hostname that shows in your dashboard as the target):


| Record | Name | Target                               |
|--------|------|--------------------------------------|
| CNAME  | sftp | yellow-rectangle-14793.sftptogo.com. |

:::tip
Adding a custom domain for your SFTP endpoint is available in all plans. However, if you'd like to change the domain that shows as default in SFTP To Go's admin dashboard, read more about this option [here](../getting-started/organization-settings#domains). This feature is only available with [certain plans](https://sftptogo.com/pricing).
