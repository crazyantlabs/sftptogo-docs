We'd hate to see you go, but we understand that sometimes it just wasn't meant to happen. Once you cancel your subscription, you'd still be able to access your organization (files and management dashboard) until your subscription period expires (i.e. end of your trial, end of the monthly subscription or end of your annual subscription). 

To cancel your subscription, go to your billing portal:

1. Click **Settings** in the dashboard menu.
2. Scroll to the billing section and click **Open your billing portal**.
3. Click **Cancel plan**.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen.
