Inbound network rules define IP address ranges from which a user can connect to your storage. They can be defined at the [organization level](../getting-started/organization_settings.md) (for all users) or at the [user level](../getting-started/creating_and_modifying_users.md) (for a specific user).

By default, users can connect to your organization's storage from any IP address.

> Note - editing inbound network rules is only available with certain plans. Read more about our different plans [here](https://sftptogo.com/pricing).
