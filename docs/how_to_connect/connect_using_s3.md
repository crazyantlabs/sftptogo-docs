To connect to your SFTP To Go storage using the S3 protocol, follow these general instructions:

1. Go to your organization dashboard (click **Dashboard** in the menu).
2. In the credentials list, expand the root credentials.
3. Copy the Amazon S3 access details to your S3 client of choice: Access key ID, Secret access key, region, and bucket.

> Note: we recommend rotating the Amazon S3 credentials every 90 days at the minimum.

> Note: S3 APIs are only available with certain plans. Read more about our different plans [here](https://sftptogo.com/pricing).
