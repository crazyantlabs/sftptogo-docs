Over the duration of the trial, the features included in the plan you signed up for will be available to you. If you wish to extend your trial or change the plan to a different one, please reach out to us via in-app chat found on the bottom-right corner of the screen.

Once your 7 days trial has ended, your plan will be automatically converted to a paying one of which you selected.

At any point during the trial, you may cancel your account by following these steps:

2. Scroll down to the billing section and click **Open your billing portal**.
3. On the billing portal page, click **Cancel Plan**.
